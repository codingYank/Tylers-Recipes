      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Season pork with salt and pepper and place in a large sauce pan. Add water until the pork is cover by 1 - 2 inches and partially cover with a lid. Bring water to a simmer and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 3 hours. Uncover the pork and pan fry, stiring frequently until pork has fallen apart.</li>
        <li>Combine tomatoes, onion, garlic, jalapeno, oregano, and cinnamon in a blender and puree until smooth. Add tomato mixture to the pork and stir well. Bring mixture to a simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated.</li>
        <li>In a bowl combine masa harina with salt and warm water. Mix until soft dough from. Let stand for 30 minutes. Stir in more water until dough is soft but not sticky. Divide into 16 equal pieces, keeping the dough covered as you work.</li>
        <li>Rub some olive oil on your hands and take one of the dough balls. Press your thumb into the center and slowly press the dough into a bowl shape about 4 inches wide. In the center of the bowl add about 1.5 tbsps of pork filling and 1.5 tsp of cheese mixture. Carefully fold the edges of the bowl in to cover the filling and shape the pupusa into a disk shape. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Lightly brush both sides of the pupusas with olive oil.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium high heat, add enough olive oil to have a depth of about 1/4 inch. Add as many pupusas to the skillet as you can and fry until golden brown. Put the cooked pupusas on a baking sheet with a cooling rack in an oven preheated to 180 degrees to stay hot while you cook the other pupusas.</li>
      </ul>
